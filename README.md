# Pathfinding Algorithms

- Pathfinding Algorithms implemented in Unity 3D. The framework is a connected unweighted graph of nodes (see node.cs).

- **Implemented Algorithms:**  
  - **A*** (A-Star)
  - **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)**  
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
